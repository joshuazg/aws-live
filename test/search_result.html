Start your web application:

Run your Python web application (e.g., python app.py) and access it in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:5000).
This is a basic example of how you can implement a search function using Python, HTML, and a Python-based database. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to make adjustments and potentially use a more sophisticated database and query system.
